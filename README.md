#Audio Overkill

## Explaination

YES, this is the PSF/PSF2 plugin torn from audacious and made into a standalone audio player.  Reason?  Because I wanted to listen
to my .psf files on loop indefintley, and for some odd reason Audacious didn't offer that feature.

For now, I'm using this to listen to PSX music until I learn to implement a 'play indefinetly' option for the Audacious plugin.

## Future

After having added a neat indicator for each channel, I might expand this into a full video game music oriented player.  The next format I'm looking at for adding is .vgm using code from [VGMPlay](https://github.com/vgmrips/vgmplay).  Also I should complete support for PSF2 files.  Things are buggy and primitive, and it bugs me.

## Licensing and Credits

The PSF/PSF2 plugin is uses code from PeOPS  ( /psf/peops* ) written by Pete Bernert, and is licensed under GPL v2.

The remaining code except for "main.cc", is from Audio Overload, and is BSD.  Some of it has been modified.
