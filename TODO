 
 - finish vgm support: find way to properly read wchar_t encoding from
	vgm format for rendering text with.

 - consider usf/spc/nsf support:
 -  modes for keeping track of current/selected format.
 -  functions such as:  detecting file type, loading based on current format, playing based on current format.
 -  make psf_execute into a pointer function name file_execute.
 
 - consider having channel display have separate buffers
		for different chips/systems, as right now
		some vgm files using multiple chips might end up with
		a clobbered channel display.
